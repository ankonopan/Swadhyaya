          <h2>Patanjali's Yoga Sutras</h2>
          <p>This book contains 196 concise sentences, well-connected as flowers in a garland, presenting the subject of
            Yoga in its entirety. Agamas or Vedas look upon Lord as a limitless conscious- being and a repository of all
            knowledge. Knowledge of Yoga also, therefore, comes from the lord and has existed for millennia. Even though
            it came much later, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is a pioneering work as the eight limbs of yoga summed up in
            this book form the basis of Ashtanga Yoga. One meaning of the word Yoga is self-knowledge. A life-style
            followed to gain self-knowledge is also called Yoga. Yoga is, therefore, both the journey and the
            destination. The book addresses both categories of yogis, those who are naturally contemplative and are
            pursuing knowledge exclusively (Chapter 1 -Samadhi Pada); and those who are pursuing other goals in life but
            have a value for self-knowledge and would like to become contemplative (Chapter 2 - Sadhana Pada).</p>

          <h2>Bhagavad-gītā</h2>
          <p>Gita means a song. The prefix Bhagavad has two valid meanings – from the lord, and, about the lord.
            Therefore, we can say that Bhagavad-Gita is a song where the lord is singing his own glories; or Gita is the
            introduction of the lord in his own words.
            As we assimilate the teaching, we find that the Lord is saying to each one of us, You are Me. In other
            words, in the vision of Gita, the individual self is equated to universal self. This transcending
            understanding of oneself takes away the conflict in performance of one’s duties and allows one to live one’s
            life freely.</p>
